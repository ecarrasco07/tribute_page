                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>2004</strong> - At just 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, Lionel Messi makes his official league debut for Barcelona.</li>
                        <li><strong>2005</strong> - Messi makes his debut for Argentina in a friendly against Hungary at the age of 18.</li>
                        <li><strong>2005</strong> - There's no doubt Barcelona has something special on its hands and the world is starting to take notice as well when he's named the Golden Boy -- the award for the best young player in Europe.</li>
                        <li><strong>2006</strong> - Coming on in the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, Messi becomes the youngest-ever player to represent Argentina at the World Cup.</li>
                        <li><strong>2008</strong> - Messi wins the Olympic Gold for Agrentina.</li>
                        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Having inspired Barcelona to an historic treble in the same year -- it won the league, domestic cup and Champions League -- Messi is officially named the best player in the world for the first time.</li>
                        <li><strong>2012</strong> - Goals just keep coming for the magician at club level and, at just 24, he breaks Barcelona's scoring record previously held by Cesar Rodriguez.</li>
                        <li><strong>2019</strong> - Messi's club statistics over his career can only be challenged by one man, Cristiano Ronaldo. The pair practically share the Ballon d'Or award for a decade but, in 2019, Messi wins it for a record sixth time. Ronaldo is still on five.</li>
                        <li><strong>2021</strong> - Messi leaves Barcelona to join PSG.</li>
